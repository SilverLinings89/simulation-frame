## About

This repo was created based on the wasm bindgen repo to jumpstart my work on a small simulation framework that can be embedded as a website. 
It is upposed to handle various small simulations and to both run and show the simulations in the browser based on execution in rust and web bindings via wasm. 

## 🚴 Usage

### 🛠️ Build with `wasm-pack build`

```
wasm-pack build
```

### 🔬 Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```
